# ItemChecklist Architecture

This document describes the design and data flow of the ItemChecklist mod
beyond what fits in the mod's `CLAUDE.md` overview.

## UI Architecture

ItemChecklist uses Core Keeper's native `SpriteRenderer`-based UI stack,
mediated by CoreLib's `UserInterfaceModule`. This is the only viable approach
in CK — uGUI (Canvas/Image) is structurally incompatible because CK's
`UIMouse` does a `Physics.Raycast` in the UI layer and Canvas elements have no
Collider. See `CLAUDE.md § Mod-Specific Gotchas` for the structural
explanation and the survey of 10 CK UI mods (all use SpriteRenderer).

### Mod Load → Registration → Mount → Open → Close

**Mod load + registration (EarlyInit → ModObjectLoaded):**

1. `IMod.EarlyInit` — `UserInterfaceModule.LoadSubmodule()`. Must precede
   any `RegisterModUI` call.
2. `IMod.ModObjectLoaded` — `UserInterfaceModule.RegisterModUI(windowPrefab)`.
   Called once when the mod's `GameObject` (from the AssetBundle) is
   available.
3. CoreLib's postfix on `UIManager.Init` instantiates the prefab into
   `UIManager.chestInventoryUI.transform.parent` — this is the canonical
   CK UI mount point used by every IModUI implementation.

**Open path (F1 → visible window):**

4. F1 is a toggle (Iter-4). The keybind (wired since Iter-1 via the CoreLib
   `ControlMappingModule`, polled in `IMod.Update`) drives a 3-way branch
   keyed off *real visibility* (`ItemChecklistWindow.Instance.Root.activeSelf`,
   **not** CoreLib's `currentInterface`, which the auto-hide patch can leave
   transiently stale):
   - window visible → close via
     `Manager.ui.HideAllInventoryAndCraftingUI(forceClose: false)` (the same
     path Escape/E use — see Close path);
   - else a Vanilla menu/inventory is open
     (`Manager.ui.isPlayerInventoryShowing`) → ignore, so F1 never opens on
     top of one;
   - else → `UserInterfaceModule.OpenModUI("ItemChecklist:Window")`.
5. CoreLib calls `ItemChecklistWindow.ShowUI()`.
6. `ShowUI` delegates to `ItemChecklistContent.PopulateContent` (Iter-3.8):
   it lazily grows the fixed row pool (`EnsurePool`), sets the catalog count
   (`SetCount`), reflection-wires the scrollable + invokes `UpdateScrollHeight`,
   then `ResetScroll` + forced `RefreshVisible`. No per-entry instantiation
   happens anymore — the persistent ~N-row pool is recycled by the scroll
   system. See § Viewport Virtualization and the UIScrollWindow Reference
   below.

**Close path (Escape / E / F1 → hidden window):**

7. Player presses Escape or E, **or** F1 while the window is open →
   `HideAllInventoryAndCraftingUI` is called (F1 via the Iter-4 toggle,
   with `forceClose: false` to mirror `PlayerController.CloseAnyOpenInventory`).
8. CoreLib's postfix on `HideAllInventoryAndCraftingUI` calls
   `IModUI.HideUI()` for every registered mod UI **and** clears
   `UserInterfaceModule.currentInterface` (via `ClearModUIData`). Clearing
   it releases the player from menu-state — a bare `HideUI()` on the F1-close
   path would leave `currentInterface` dangling and freeze movement.
9. `ItemChecklistWindow.HideUI()` calls `root.SetActive(false)` only
   (Iter-3.8) — the persistent row pool is **not** destroyed on close. The
   `PugText.Clear()` pool-teardown (the old per-destroy leak fix) moved to
   `ItemChecklistContent.OnDestroy`, which runs only on full pool teardown.

**Mutual exclusion with Vanilla menus (Iter-4):** `InventoryOpenAutoHidePatch`
postfixes `UIManager.OnPlayerInventoryOpen` — the single funnel every Vanilla
inventory/crafting/vendor open routes through (plain TAB via
`PlayerController.OpenPlayerInventory`; chests/stations/vendors via wrappers
that all delegate to it). If the checklist is visible when a Vanilla menu
opens, it calls a **bare** `HideUI()` (not `HideAllInventoryAndCraftingUI`,
which would re-close the just-opening menu). The briefly-dangling
`currentInterface` is harmless: the Vanilla menu covers it and its close
clears it, and the F1 toggle reads `Root.activeSelf`, not `currentInterface`.
This coherence holds **only** while `ShowWithPlayerInventory == false` — that
early-returns `OpenModUI` before `OnPlayerInventoryOpen`, so opening the
checklist does not trip its own postfix.

**Cursor/WASD-block/Escape handling:** all handled by CoreLib and CK's
`isAnyInventoryShowing` postfix chain — zero patches for those. Iter-4 adds
exactly one Harmony postfix (the mutual-exclusion patch above).

### Pattern Matrix (10 surveyed CK UI mods)

| Approach | Mods using it |
|---|---|
| SpriteRenderer + Layer GUI + UIelement | 10 / 10 |
| uGUI (Canvas, Image, Text) | 0 / 10 |
| CoreLib UserInterfaceModule | ~3 (BookMod, DummyMod, ItemChecklist) |
| Custom Harmony-based open/close | ~7 |

Production reference implementations:
- **limoka/BookMod** — ~145 IMod LoC + ~162 UI LoC, uses UserInterfaceModule
- **limoka/DummyMod** — ~87 IMod LoC + ~84 UI LoC, minimal template

## UIScrollWindow Reference

This section captures the decompile findings for `UIScrollWindow` (in
`Pug.Other.dll`). Key behavioral facts that affect ItemChecklist are also
summarized in `CLAUDE.md § CK Decompile References`; this section gives the
full internal picture for anyone implementing a new `IScrollable` or
diagnosing scroll behavior.

### Awake Logic

`UIScrollWindow.Awake()` calls `GetComponent<IScrollable>()`. If the result
is `null`, the scroll window **permanently disables itself** — `enabled = false`
and the component stops processing input. The `IScrollable` implementor
(`ItemChecklistContent`) must be on the same `GameObject` as
`UIScrollWindow`, or `Awake` must fire after the component is added.

### UpdateScrollHeight

```
scrollHeight = scrollable.TotalHeight - scrollWindow.windowHeight
```

Called via reflection (`API.Reflection.Invoke(MiUpdateScrollHeight, ...)`).
Must be called after content changes before `SetScrollValue`, or the scroll
range is stale.

### SetScrollValue Semantics (inverted)

`SetScrollValue(float normalizedScrollValue)`:

- `1f` → **top** of list: lerps content `localY` toward `minScrollPos = 0`.
- `0f` → **bottom** of list: lerps content `localY` toward `ScrollHeight`
  (content shifted up by full scroll height).

This is counter-intuitive. Iter-3 passed `0f` and caused rows to overlap
the title element (content shifted ~20 units up). **Always use `1f` or
`ResetScroll()` to go to the top.**

`ResetScroll()` is a public method equivalent to `SetScrollValue(1f)` — use
it as the canonical "go to top" call.

### Post-Content-Spawn Sequence

After spawning or replacing scroll content, call in this order (ItemBrowser
`EntriesList.SetEntries` pattern):

```csharp
API.Reflection.SetValue(MiScrollable, scrollWindow, scrollableImpl);
API.Reflection.Invoke(MiUpdateScrollHeight, scrollWindow);
scrollWindow.SetScrollValue(1f);  // or scrollWindow.ResetScroll()
```

### LateUpdate Scroll Processing

`UIScrollWindow.LateUpdate` applies the current scroll delta to
`content.localPosition.y`. It reads mouse scroll wheel input only when the
cursor is inside the window bounds (checked via `bounds.Contains`).

### IScrollable Contract

```csharp
public interface IScrollable
{
    void UpdateContainingElements(float scroll);  // per-frame recycle callback
    bool IsBottomElementSelected { get; }
    bool IsTopElementSelected { get; }
    float GetCurrentWindowHeight();
    float TotalHeight { get; }        // negative: grows downward from 0
}
```

**Key implementation notes:**

- `UpdateContainingElements(float scroll)` is the per-frame callback the
  scroll system invokes with the current scroll offset. IB's `EntriesList`
  treats it as a no-op (content manages itself), but ItemChecklist's
  `ItemChecklistContent` uses it as the **viewport recycle driver** — see
  § Viewport Virtualization. Do not mistake it for arg-less.
- `TotalHeight` is negative and grows more negative as rows are added.
  Row placement formula: `row.localY = TotalHeight` before adding each
  row's height. TotalHeight starts at 0 and goes negative.
- `GetCurrentWindowHeight()` returns the window's clipping height in world
  units (used by `UpdateScrollHeight` formula).
- Hierarchy comparison:
  - **IB:** `ScrollWindow` → `ScrollContainer` → individual row GameObjects
  - **ItemChecklist:** `RowsContainer` → `Content` → individual row GameObjects
  Both hierarchies work; the key is that `Content` is the object whose
  `localY` is manipulated by the scroll system.

## Viewport Virtualization (Iter-3.8)

The catalog grows to ~10720 entries. The pre-Iter-3.8 design instantiated one
`ItemRow` GameObject per entry on every open (`SpawnRows`), which froze the
window ~905 ms. Iter-3.8 replaced that with a fixed-size pool of row
GameObjects recycled as the user scrolls, so the GameObject count is bounded
by the *visible* window, not the catalog size. Open latency dropped from
~905 ms to ~0–7 ms.

**Why hand-built — CK ships no recycler template.** `CookBookUI` (CK's own
cooked-food browser) is **not** a viewport recycler: it builds a *fixed* pool
of `MAX_ROWS × MAX_COLUMNS` slots (50×5 = 250) once and breaks at
`num >= itemSlots.Count`, so entries past slot 250 are simply never shown. It
scrolls by translating the whole pool under the clip mask, recycling nothing.
That is fine for ≤250 recipes but unusable for ~10720 entries. No CK class
recycles rows by index, so ItemChecklist implements its own on top of the
`IScrollable` contract.

### Pool model

`ItemChecklistContent` (the `IScrollable` implementor, which sits on
`scrollingContent`) owns a fixed pool of

```
N = ceil(windowHeight / RowHeight) + 2     // ~5–6 rows (RowHeight = 2.5)
```

row GameObjects. The pool only ever *grows* — `EnsurePool` grows toward
`ComputePoolSize()` and never early-returns short (an early-return bug would
leave the pool undersized after a window resize). Pool rows are children of
`scrollingContent` and are positioned at content-local `-(idx * RowHeight)`.

### Recycle driver — `UpdateContainingElements(float scroll)`

The scroll system invokes `IScrollable.UpdateContainingElements(scroll)` every
frame with the current scroll offset. `ItemChecklistContent` uses it as the
recycle driver:

```
firstIndex = floor(scroll / RowHeight)
if firstIndex == _lastFirstIndex: return    // per-frame no-op guard
_lastFirstIndex = firstIndex
// rebind each of the N pool rows to catalog entry (firstIndex + i)
```

The `_lastFirstIndex` guard skips the rebind when the first-visible index has
not changed since the last frame (most frames). A separate `RefreshVisible()`
forces an unconditional rebind (it resets `_lastFirstIndex = -1` first), used
on window-open, on a discovery event, and on re-bake — cases where the catalog
*contents* changed even though the scroll offset did not.

### Full-height reporting

Only ~N row GameObjects exist, but the scrollbar / scroll range must reflect
the whole catalog. `ItemChecklistContent.GetCurrentWindowHeight()` returns

```
count * RowHeight
```

i.e. the height the full catalog *would* occupy. `UIScrollWindow.UpdateScrollHeight`
(`scrollHeight = TotalHeight - windowHeight`) then computes a scroll range that
spans every entry, so scrolling reaches the last row even though no GameObject
exists for it until it scrolls into view.

### Open/close lifecycle

`ItemChecklistWindow` no longer spawns or destroys rows; it delegates to
`ItemChecklistContent.PopulateContent`:

1. `EnsurePool` — lazily grows the pool to `ComputePoolSize()` (grows-only).
2. `SetCount(catalogCount)` — records the full entry count for height reporting.
3. Reflection-wire the scrollable + invoke `UpdateScrollHeight` (the
   `UIScrollWindow` post-content-spawn sequence; see § Post-Content-Spawn
   Sequence). Order matters: `UpdateScrollHeight` **before** `ResetScroll`.
4. `ResetScroll()` — go to top.
5. `RefreshVisible()` — forced rebind so the pool shows the correct entries.

`HideUI` no longer destroys anything — it calls `root.SetActive(false)` only,
so the pool survives across opens. The `PugText.Clear()` pool-teardown (the
former per-destroy leak fix) moved to `ItemChecklistContent.OnDestroy`, which
runs only on full pool teardown. Because rows are no longer destroyed per
close, the old main-menu-PugText-blanking symptom can no longer occur.

> **Load-bearing invariant:** `UIScrollWindow.Awake` sets `enabled = false`
> *permanently* if its serialized `scrollable` reference does not resolve to a
> component on the same GameObject. The doc-comment recording this in the code
> is load-bearing — do not remove it.

### Prefab geometry invariant

For the first and last rows to sit flush against the window edges:

- `UIScrollWindow.windowHeight` **must equal** the SpriteMask height.
- The mask top **must align** to row 0's top.

To grow the mask **top-only** (keeping the bottom edge fixed), change both the
scale and the position in a 2:1 ratio:

```
mask.scale.y    += X
mask.localPos.y += X / 2
```

Changing only one of the two shifts the whole mask instead of extending it
upward. This was settled by empirical 4-build calibration, not by a static
reading of the prefab — the final values are `windowHeight = 6.5`,
mask `scale.y = 6.5`, mask `localPos.y = -2.0`.

### Scrollbar (Iter-5)

The window prefab now wires CK's native `ScrollBar` + `ScrollBarHandle` into
`UIScrollWindow.scrollBar`. This is a **pure prefab change — no mod C#**: once
`scrollBar` is set, `UIScrollWindow.LateUpdate` calls `UpdateScrollbar()` every
frame the scroll position or height changes, which calls
`ScrollBar.UpdateScrollBarPosition(normalizedPosition)` — driving handle
sizing, position, **and** mouse-wheel sync. (Verified against Item Browser,
whose working scrollbar has zero scrollbar C#.) Mouse-wheel scrolling already
worked before; the new wiring just makes the handle reflect it.

**Prefab subtree** (under the window `root` GO): `ScrollBar` GO (holds the
`ScrollBar` component; localPos `(4.9, -0.5, 0)`) → `ScrollBarRoot` child
(= `ScrollBar.root`, the GO CK toggles) → `ScrollBarTrack` (track
`SpriteRenderer` = `ScrollBar.background`, size `(0.25, 6.5)` = viewport
height) + `ScrollBarHandle` (`ScrollBarHandle` + 3D `BoxCollider` =
`ScrollBar.handle`) → `ScrollBarHandleSprite` (= `handleSpriteRenderer`) +
`ScrollBarHandleSelected` (= `optionalSelectedMarker`). Sprites are the
`ui_scrollbar_*` sub-sprites of the `ui_classic` atlas.

**Three load-bearing facts (proven during Iter-5 builds):**

1. **`maskInteraction: None` on every scrollbar `SpriteRenderer`.** They sit at
   sorting orders 46/47/48 inside the SpriteMask custom range (40..55), so
   without `maskInteraction = None` the row mask would clip them. `None`
   exempts them entirely.
2. **`handleCollider` is a 3D `BoxCollider`** (`!u!65`), not `BoxCollider2D` —
   CK's `UIMouse` does a 3D `Physics.Raycast`. Size `(0.5, 1.25, 4)`; the `y`
   is overwritten each frame by `ScrollBar.UpdateHandleSize`, the `z: 4` is
   raycast depth.
3. **`ButtonUIElement.LateUpdate` toggles GameObject *activity*** of
   `spritesShownUnpressed` (active when `!leftClickIsHeldDown`) and
   `spritesShownPressed` (active when held). The same GO must never be in both
   lists (the pressed loop runs last and wins, so it would only show while
   held → handle vanishes at idle). With a single handle sprite, both lists are
   left **empty**: `handleSpriteRenderer` is rendered independently by
   `ScrollBar` and stays always-visible, while the selected-border shows on
   hover/selection via `optionalSelectedMarker` (toggled by
   `OnSelected`/`OnDeselected`).

For hand-wiring the CK component `m_Script` refs (portable fileID, install-local
guid), see the `project-corekeeper-script-fileid-derivation` memory. Scroll
arrows stay unwired (`arrowUp`/`arrowDown` = `{fileID: 0}`); track-position
fine-tuning + real sprites are deferred to Iter-9.

## Data Architecture

### ItemCatalog Two-Loop Bake (Iter-3.7)

`ItemCatalog.Bake()` runs once per world-load, triggered from the
`PlayerController.OnOccupied` coroutine (after
`ClientWorldStateSystem.HasRunAtLeastOnce`).

**Pre-cache phase** (before the loops):

```
turnsIntoMap: ObjectID → ObjectID   (ingredientLookup[entity].turnsIntoFood)
tierMap:      ObjectID → (base, rare, epic)  (from CookedFoodCD fields)
```

**Loop 1 — Standard items:**

```
for objectId in PugDatabase.objectsByType.Keys:
    if IsCookedFood(objectId): skip   // handled by Loop 2
    emit CatalogEntry(objectId, variation=0)
```

**Loop 2 — Cooked-food α-enumeration:**

```
for i1 in ingredients:
    for i2 in ingredients where i2 >= i1:   // upper triangle, symmetric
        family = turnsIntoMap[GetPrimaryIngredient(i1, i2)]
        var = GetFoodVariation(i1, i2)
        for tier in [base, rare, epic]:
            emit CatalogEntry(tier_objectId, variation=var)
```

**Resulting catalog size:** ~10720 entries (~1240 standard + ~9480
cooked-food permutations: 3160 pairs × 3 tiers).

**Expected bake time:** < 200 ms on a typical machine (empirically ~384 ms
on this machine for the full ~10720-entry bake). Bake time is independent
of the Iter-3.8 open/render-time work: Iter-3.8 virtualized the row
*rendering* (the open-latency fix — see § Viewport Virtualization), not the
catalog bake. The bake still runs once per world-load in the
`PlayerController.OnOccupied` coroutine.

### DiscoveredState Packed-Long Key Schema

`DiscoveredState` stores discovered items as `HashSet<long>` where each
key is a packed long: `(objectId << 32) | (uint)variation`.

**Design rationale:**

- GC-free: boxing-free value type, no `(int, int)` tuple allocation per
  lookup.
- Negative-variation-safe: casting to `uint` before OR-ing prevents sign
  extension from corrupting the upper 32 bits.
- Trivially debuggable: `key >> 32` = objectId, `(int)(uint)key` = variation.

**API evolution:**

| Version | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Iter-3.6 | `HashSet<int>` | objectId only, no variation support |
| Iter-3.7+ | `HashSet<long>` | packed `(objectId, variation)` |

`PackKey(int objectId, int variation)` is the canonical factory. Never
construct the key inline — go through `PackKey` so the casting logic
stays in one place.

### Cooked-Food α-Enumeration

The α-algorithm derives entirely from `InventoryUtility.cs:~1626`
(`turnsIntoFood` lookup) and `CookedFoodCD` (variation + tiers).

**Pick-family derivation:**

For ingredient pair `(i1, i2)`, the result family is:
```
primary   = CookedFoodCD.GetPrimaryIngredient(i1, i2)
family    = ingredientLookup[primary.prefabEntity].turnsIntoFood
variation = CookedFoodCD.GetFoodVariation(i1, i2)
           = (primaryObjectId << 16) | secondaryObjectId
```

**Symmetry:** `GetFoodVariation(a, b) == GetFoodVariation(b, a)` because
`GetPrimaryIngredient` uses a deterministic tiebreaker (Seed 87931 RNG).
The upper-triangle iteration `(i2 >= i1)` safely deduplicates symmetric
pairs.

**Three-tier multiplication:**

Each `(family, variation)` tuple maps to three `CatalogEntry` rows:
base family ObjectID, `CookedFoodCD.rareVersion`, `CookedFoodCD.epicVersion`.

**Empirical validation:** runtime spike (May 2026) confirmed 3160 unique
pairs × 3 tiers = 9480 cooked-food entries, matching the expected catalog
size.

**`ObjectIDExtensions.IsCookedFood`** range: `objectId ∈ [9500, 9599]`
(max 100 family-item slots). Loop 1 uses this to skip standard-item
enumeration of cooked-food ObjectIDs — they are emitted by Loop 2 instead.

## Rarity Colouring (Iter-6)

Each row surfaces its CK rarity on two axes: a tinted item name (all
rarities) and a rarity border around the icon (Uncommon and above). The
rarity is a **distinct axis** from the Iter-3.7 cooked-food Base/Rare/Epic
tiers — each cooked-food tier carries its own `ObjectInfo.rarity`.

### Data flow

1. **Bake** — `ItemCatalog.Entry` carries a `Rarity Rarity` field, resolved
   from `PugDatabase.GetObjectInfo(objectId, variation).rarity` via a
   `rarityCache` that mirrors the existing `iconCache` (populated in both
   bake loops, read at the single `new Entry(...)` site). UI-independent: the
   bake never touches `Manager.ui`.
2. **Rebind** — `ItemChecklistContent.Rebind` resolves the colour per visible
   row: `Manager.ui.GetSlotBorderRarityColor(entry.Rarity,
   useDefaultColorForCommon: true, defaultColor: _defaultLabelColor)`. With
   `true`, Common/Poor return `_defaultLabelColor` (the label's prefab default,
   captured once from the first pool row) → no visible tint; Uncommon+ return
   `slotBorderRarityColors[(int)(rarity + 1)]`. The resolved `Color` and the
   `Rarity` enum are passed to `ItemRow.Bind`.
3. **Paint** — `ItemRow.Bind` sets `label.SetTempColor(colour,
   keepColorOnStart: true)` (after `Render`; see `gotchas.md § PugText tint`)
   and toggles `rarityBorder.enabled = rarity >= Rarity.Uncommon`, colouring it
   with the same `Color`. `ItemRow` stays decoupled from `Manager.ui` — it
   paints the colour it is handed.

`enum Rarity` (`Pug.Base.dll`): `Poor = -1, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic,
Legendary`; the colour-list index is `(int)(rarity + 1)`.

### Border SpriteRenderer

The `RarityBorder` child of the `ItemRow` prefab uses **`maskInteraction: 1`
(VisibleInsideMask)** — it scrolls and clips *with* the rows (the opposite of
the Iter-5 scrollbar's `None`). Sorting order 49 places the hollow frame above
the icon (order 48). It defaults to `m_Enabled: 0` (hidden until `Bind` proves
rarity ≥ Uncommon). The sprite is the placeholder `ui_rarity_border` (a white
1-px hollow frame, tinted at runtime); the frame is intentionally thick (a 1-px
ring on an 8×8 sprite uniformly stretched) — real 9-slice / pixel-art polish is
deferred to Iter-9.
